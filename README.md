# PDF Question Answering Assistant

This project is a Node.js application that allows you to ask questions about a PDF document. It uses the `langchain` library to process and retrieve relevant parts of the document to answer your questions. The PDF is split into chunks and stored in an in-memory vector store for efficient retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can check this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from here.

Setup
Initialize the project
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Node.js project:
npm init -y
